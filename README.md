# Streaming Platform UI

## Description

This is my **third UI clone project**, inspired by a popular streaming platform. Out of all my clones so far, this one feels the most polished and visually appealing. I focused a lot on **clean design, responsive layout, and realistic details**.

The colors, spacing, and structure came together really well, making the UI look close to an actual product.

## How I Built It

-   Wrote **clean and readable code** by using semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<section>`).
-   Implemented a **floating label effect** for the input field — where the placeholder smoothly moves to the top when focused.
-   Added **ranking numbers on cards**, which gave the UI a very realistic feel.
-   Made the project **fully responsive** across devices. Surprisingly, responsiveness was not too difficult this time; it felt natural compared to my earlier projects.

## Challenges I Faced

-   **Input Design:** Creating the floating label effect was tricky. I had to rely on online resources and experimentation. I still don’t fully “own” this concept, but I know with practice and future projects it’ll click.
-   **Flexbox with Inputs:** At first, I struggled with using `flex: 1` to make the input scale properly. After trial and error, I finally understood how it works.
-   **Attention to Detail:** Balancing spacing, alignment, and proportions took time, but I learned how small tweaks make a huge difference.

Overall, this project boosted my confidence in handling layouts and responsiveness. Each clone I do feels like a step forward in both coding skills and design sense.
